<p>Hi, I'm Kris, a front-end developer and designer from Vancouver, BC. I build responsive websites for clients across North America.</p>

<p>I'm most skilled with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but also know WordPress, Bootstrap, SEO and Shopify. I love to work with others, learn new technologies, and build successful products.</p>
