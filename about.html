<h1>About</h1>

<p>I'm Kris Wignes, a front-end developer and designer from Vancouver, BC. I studied business at the University of Maine and web development at British Columbia Institute of Technology. I've been in the industry for over 4 years and continue to love every second of it.</p> 

I started out as an intern at Vancouver Community Network where I fixed computers and  worked on their web-based text messaging platform. This gave me a lot of skills to take the next steps in my career. After the internship, I jumped into various contract jobs, mostly building websites, and also some UI development work.</p>

<p>I've had the opportunity to work with many great clients all over North America in different industries including healthcare, engineering, and tourism.</p>

<p>Some of the services I offer include: website design and development, support and maintenance, and WordPress development and training. I'm most skilled at HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - being the core tools for building a site. I'm also experienced with WordPress, Shopify, PhotoShop, and various other tools and platforms.</p>
