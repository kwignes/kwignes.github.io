<h1>Hi, I'm Kris</h1>
<p>I'm a Front-End Developer from Vancouver, BC currently at <a href="https://www.exware.com/" target="_blank">Exware Systems</a>. I build websites and provide support to over 90 clients across North America and have 3+ years experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and WordPress. I'm also exploring AngularJS and Firebase.</p>

<p>I studied web development at <a href="https://www.bcit.ca/" target="_blank">BCIT</a> in Vancouver and Business at the <a href="https://machias.edu/" target="_blank">University of Maine at Machias</a>. I love good design and clean code. A website has to look beautiful but also communicate a message. Apart from coding, I enjoy soccer and spending time with family and friends.</p>

<p>Check out some of my <a href="/">work</a> and feel free to <a href="/contact/">contact me</a> about your next project!</p>
