<p>My name is Kris. I'm a front-end developer from Vancouver building responsive, user-friendly websites.</p> 

<p>I studied web development at <a href="https://www.bcit.ca/" target="_blank">BCIT</a>  and have over three years of experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and WordPress.</p> 

<p>I love good design and clean code. A website has to look beautiful but also communicate a message. Feel free to <a href="/contact/">contact me</a> about your next project.</p>
