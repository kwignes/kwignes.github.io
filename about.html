<p>Hi, I’m Kris. I’m a front-end developer and designer from Vancouver, BC.</p>

<p>I build responsive, easy-to-use websites for large and small companies across North America. I’m most skilled at HTML and CSS, but also experienced with PHP, JavaScript, jQuery, SEO, and PhotoShop.</p>

<p>Outside of the web, I love to play soccer, run marathons and stay active. I’m a highly motivated and friendly individual, driven to deliver the best quality products. Feel free to contact me about your next project.</p>
