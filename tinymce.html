   <p><strong>Description:</strong> A tool for inserting responsive grids using Exware's content management system.</p>
    <p>Clients can easily add and update board member pages or portfolios without having to code. They can choose the number of grid items to display, insert their content, and publish. On the front-end, the grid uses floats and a clearfix.</p>
	<p>This tool provides an alternative to tables which can be difficult in responsive design and complex for users.</p>
