Hi, I'm Kris. I'm a front-end developer and designer from Vancouver, BC. 

I build responsive, easy-to-use websites for large and small companies across North America. I'm most skilled at HTML and CSS, but also experienced with PHP, JavaScript, jQuery, SEO, and PhotoShop.

Outside of the web, I love to play soccer, run marathons and stay active. I'm a highly motivated and friendly individual, driven to deliver the best quality products. Feel free to contact me about your next project.
